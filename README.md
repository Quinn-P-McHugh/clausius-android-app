# Clausius
Clausius is a visual and intuitive Android app enabling students, teachers, and engineers alike to acquire the thermodynamic properties of water for a given thermodynamic state with just the touch of a finger. By using the app with a tablet device, users can touch an on-screen temperature-entropy chart and instantly retrieve all the thermodynamic properties of water associated with that point.

## Motivation
Current methods of retrieving the thermodynamic properties of water at a given thermodynamic state are tedious at best. To retrieve these values, one can use the following methods:
* Refer to a [temperature-entropy diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature%E2%80%93entropy_diagram) and manually estimate or calculate the thermodynamic properties, such as temperature and enthalpy, at a specified point. -- This method is good for developing an understanding of the relationships between properties, but hand calculation is often slow.
* Refer to [steam tables](http://thermopedia.com/content/1150Begal), a collection of several large tables containing thermodynamic properties associated with a range of thermodynamic states -- Although accurate, this method does not provide a visual for developing a good understanding of the relationships between properties and only values for specific thermodynamic states can be retrieved.
* Use an [online thermodynamic property calculator](https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/) -- Highly accurate and flexible, but again, this does not does not provide a visual for developing a good understanding of the relationship between properties.

Clausius was first developed as an iOS app. This project seeks to develop an Android version of that app to enable use on a wider range of devices.

## Disclaimer
Clausius should be only be used as an educational tool for practicing thermodynamics calculations or understanding the relationships between properties. It should NOT be used in a professional setting to inform conclusions about any kind of thermodynamic process. To calculate thermophysical properties of various fluids, we recommend using the [Thermophysical Properties of Fluid Systems Calculator](https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) instead.
