# Clausius
Clausius is a visual and intuitive Android app enabling students, teachers, and engineers alike to acquire the thermodynamic properties of water for a given thermodynamic state with just the touch of a finger.

## Motivation
Although precise, current methods of retrieving thermodynamic properties of a material at a given thermodynamic state are tedious at best. 

In addition, Clausius currently exists as an iOS app but it has not been ported to Android. This project seeks to make that happen.

## Build Status
This app is currently under development. To see the project

## Code Style
